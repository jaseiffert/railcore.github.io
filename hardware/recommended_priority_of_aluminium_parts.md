title: Recommended priority of Aluminium Parts
---  

The recommended order replacement of the RailCore II ZL series 3D printed parts with aluminium replacements is:-
    
1. X Carriages, Idler pulley mount set & Stepper mounts - *recommended for ZL and **highly recommended** for ZLT*
1. **(ZL only)** Hotend mount 
1. Z Yokes - ***highly recommended** for ZLT*
1. Z Brackets - *reported as useful for hitting higher speeds*
1. **(ZLT only)** Hotend mount
1. Magnetic heated bed
1. Halo - *doesn't seem to improve prints, but does pre-align belts*
1. Aluminum Y carriage - *lighter than the printed part, and saves you weight*

### Longest swap times after assembly

1. Magnetic heated bed - *if possible, try to incorporate this into your inital build.*
1. Z brackets
1. Halo
