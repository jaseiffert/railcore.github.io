### Guides

   * [RailCore II 300ZL/ZLT Assembly Guide - (Original Self Sourcer version)](https://railcore.page.link/guide)
   
### Materials & BOM
This information is aimed primarily at self-sourcers. Naturally it is of use to kit builders too.

   * [RailCore II 300ZL/ZLT Bill Of Materials](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sxKl6h23SXfuNM7hNiX35rIrpISw8AruEEcNl2Fvibk/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Recommended Additional 3D Printed Parts
 * [Cooling Shroud by James Tongue](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3367622)
   * [Remix with supports already included](https://github.com/railcore/parts/blob/master/Other%20Printed%20Parts/Cooling%20Shroud/Duct_Printed_Carriage_Supports.stl) - this version prints very well as-is with no additional supports
   * [Remix oriented for easier printing setup](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3461781) - will need sliced with additional supports on most printers
