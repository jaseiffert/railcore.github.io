title: Build Surfaces
---  

There is plenty of good information out there on bed surfaces and their adhesion. This is just a summary of any surfaces when used with the Railcore.

**Everflex™ PEI** Double-sided and textured powder coated PEI flex plates offered by Subtle Design. Compatible with all forms of sensors and probes. Printed parts self release when cooled down. [https://subtle.design/everflex](https://subtle.design/everflex)

**Lokbuild** is the build surface on the BOM. Compatible with dc42's mini-differential IR sensor and BLtouch. [http://lokbuild.com](http://lokbuild.com)

**PrintBite+** - printed parts “self release” as the heat bed cools down with this surface. However be aware that it seems that it may be translucent to IR and so not a good surface when combined with dc42's mini-differential IR sensor (which is the standard on the BOM) [https://flex3drive.com/printbite/](https://flex3drive.com/printbite/)

**BuildTak** Works well with BLTouch, folks report erratic results with IR. Stuff sometimes ticks too well when used on a fixed bed; is best suited for a removable flex bed like the magnetic bed. [https://www.buildtak.com](https://www.buildtak.com)

**GeckoTek** [https://www.geckotek.co](https://www.geckotek.co)

**FR4** Some vendors sell this as "Polypropylene bed", meaning for PRINTING PP on, not 'made from pp'. Combined with Vision Miner Nanoadhesive it makes a killer combination for higher temp filaments in a passively heated enclosure. Bed temp > 90C materials stick like cyanoacrylate until the bed temp drops below 50C or so, and then you could blow the parts off the bed with canned air.
