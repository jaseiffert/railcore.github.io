title: Lubrication

Much has been discussed on the topic of grease, oils and lubrication. There is no "best" choice here.

### Misumi rails

 * Misumi high temperature rails (SSELBT13-395)  come pre-packed with heat-resistant "Krytox GPL 225 Grease" Source: https://us.c.misumi-ec.com/book/usa_2019_msm_fa/pdf/0640.pdf : These greases are compatible with other PFPE/PTFE greases, but PFPE lubricants should not be mixed with other common types of lubricant. Note: The Krytox is expensive, it may be worth removing and storing as much of the pre-packaged grease as you can when you receive your high-temperature rails!
 * Standard Misumi rails come packed in "Kyodo Yushi Multemp PS NO.2" Source: https://us.misumi-ec.com/maker/misumi/mech/product/lg/faq/ :  In the US it may be hard to source, but  close alternative would be the AFB-LF from THKis a close alternative, but any grade 2 lithium grease should be fine.
 
People are also reporting that you can use a light grease such as superlube 21030 or a oil, such as superlube 51010.
Super Lube grease is noticeably quieter after switching from tri-flow PTFE oil to superlube grease.
