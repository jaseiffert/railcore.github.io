## Building
 * [RailCore Dozuki Build Guide](https://railcore.dozuki.com/c/RailCore_II) -  now the recommended method to build a RailCore kit. If you spot problems or want to assist in tidying up the new guide, join the #documentation Channel on Discord.
 * [Build FAQ](build_faq.md)
 * [Build videos](./build_videos.md) - collected works by the community.
 * [JohnOCFII RailCore II 300ZL Build Gallery](https://imgur.com/a/edVEg4K) - a rather old self-source, but plenty of images so may still be useful!

*The #help channel on Discord is also a great resource during a build. Remember to be precise and informative about your problem and understand that all assistance is voluntary and community based.*
