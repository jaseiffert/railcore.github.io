## Firmware and Configuration

Configurations for 3D printer control boards with the standard railcore configurations (Duet is the primary control board chosen for this project)

Please note that the Duet is a platform that is extremely versatile.

## Duet Configurations

 * [Duet configuration files for the Duet2 for the Filastruder build](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/og8bolggmqlfrsv/AAAbZ0enHyIRuYoy7knaQSbEa?dl=0) : These are the best files to start with your build.
 * [Project R3D Duet config](https://github.com/railcore/configs/tree/master/unmaintained/ProjectR3D/300ZL) - Deprecated.  If building a Project R3d supplied kit, consider using one of the newer configs, such as the Filastruder kit above.
 * [Community Duet config for the Duet 2](https://github.com/railcore/configs/tree/master/duet) : Use with caution. Advanced users only.
 * [Config Repository for all boards](https://github.com/railcore/configs)

## Slicers
